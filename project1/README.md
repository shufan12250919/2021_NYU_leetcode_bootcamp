### NYU 2021 spring leetcode boot camp project
## Snake & Ladder with No Graphics

The code is store in src directory
There are two java file in src,
one is main.java and the other is Game.java.

I implement the game application in Game.java,
and player should use main.java to activate the game.

Note:
1.ladder's start, end point and snake's start, end point are all unique.
  (Hence, there are no condition
    that one will encounter a point that is both part of snake and ladder.)
2.If the user didn't enter 1 or 2, the application will keep asking the user
  to enter 1 or 2.
